% algorithm:
%
% - take all the precomputed samples
% - create the subset of samples that satisfy the initial condition
% - if this subset is empty then put it equal to all the precomputed samples
% - extract from this subset
%
% Note: if the initial condition is not in the domain of the copula then
% take as initial condition the element of the domain that is the closest
% one in Euclidean sense
