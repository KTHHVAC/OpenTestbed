%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% u_t = radiator_control(y_vec,r_t,a,b) returns the valve opening 
% percentage u_t (between 0-100%), based on the vector of measured
% temperatures y_vec (in C), the desired temperature r_t (in C), and the
% coefficients a, b in the PI transfer function
% 
% C_pi[z] = (a*z+b)/(z-1),
