% algorithm:
%
% - start by finding the closest y signal (i.e., look for the x that is closest to the desired one)
% - then find the closest y in that y signal (i.e., now look for the y that is closest to the desired one given the previously computed closest x)
% - call 'delta' the distance between these closest x, y with the interested point
% - consider then all the y signals that have the associated x not more distant than delta
% - for each of these signals look for that y's that are not
